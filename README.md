# LandscapeView

This is an experiment I did, because I liked an idea of a foggy landscape background I've seen on one of the Material Design pages. LandscapeView generates vector, random, foggy landscapes with sun/moon, stars and trees. Tap and drag the view with your finger to see the resize animation.

This view can also be found in [Carbon](https://github.com/ZieIony/Carbon) sample app as a part of DependencyLayout sample:
